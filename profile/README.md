## Hydrogreen Pollub
Hydros is a prototype of an innovative three-wheeled vehicle equipped with an electric drive and **hydrogen** fuel cell. The vehicle has been designed to minimize energy losses through its aerodynamic body, incredibly low mechanical resistance, and a highly efficient drive system. The construction is based on a monocoque made of modern lightweight composite materials.

The project's goal is to participate and podium in the Shell Eco Marathon competitions. The Shell Eco Marathon competitions take place annually on three continents - Europe, America, and Asia. Shell Eco-Marathon is an event that brings together the worlds of science, technology, and industry in a competition where vehicle efficiency in terms of energy consumption is paramount.
